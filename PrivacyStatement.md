# PerformanceTestingBot
Installing the PerformanceTestingBot GitHub App explicitly grants us access to some of the data you've shared with GitHub. This can include, source code repository content, issue and pull-request content, and repository metadata.
We avoid mirroring any of this data on our own systems as much as we can. In order to provide the service that we do, we do need to store the following pieces of data ourselves:
Repository and organization names
* Pull Request numbers and ids
* Comment on Issues and Pull Requests

At any point, you have the option to:

*Uninstall the PerformanceTestingBot GitHub App, removing our access
*Request by Email or over Slack direct message that we delete any data we currently have

## Hosting Provider
The infrastructure for the PerformanceTestingBot is hosted on Amazon Web Services, therefore these third parties have full access to any data we store, and their own privacy policies will apply.
Additionally logs containing information Pull Request and Git Issues will be stored within AWS until an undetermined future date.
